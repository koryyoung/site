                    For most builds, the keycaps are the first thing you see, and thus, are the most customizable piece of a build. They come in a wide variety of colors, designs, materials, shapes, and sizes. But, just like with cases and switches, keycaps come in different types, which makes choosing the perfect keycap set easy.

                    There are main two types of materials that keycaps are made from: ABS and PBT platics. ABS are smoother and glossier than PBT, they also show wear more than PBT keycaps do. PBT keycaps are more matte and textured, they are typically more durable but louder when typing. While PBT keycaps might seem like the obvious choice due to durability, the manufacturer GMK make the best ABS keycaps available, rivialing if not beating PBT in durability and quality. However both materials are great for any build or user, so it comes down to personal preference.

                    The next thing to choose for keycaps is shape or profile. The three most common profiles are OEM, Cherry, and SA. OEM keycaps are the most common and are what most keycaps come as. Cherry profile are the second most common and are very similar to OEM, just shorter in comparison. SA, on the other hand, are much taller and rounder than OEM keycaps.
